# DATA STRUCTURES

## Introduction to Data Structures

    Data Structures is a fundamental Building Block of the Computer Science. Good Knowledge of Data Structures is must to build efficient software systems. We deal with datas all the times, and how we store, organize and group data together maters.

- A data structure is a way to store and organize data in a computer, so that it can be used efficiently.

- We talk about data structures as :
    - **Mathematical/logical models or Abstract data types [ADT]**
        - eg:- List
            - Store a given number of elements of any types
            - Read elements by position
            - Modify elements at a position
